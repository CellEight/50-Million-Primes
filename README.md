# 50-Million-Primes
If you're anything like me you often find yourself writing programs that require very long list of primes to do what they need to do. I have never been able to find a list of primes on the internet which is both in an easily parsable format and of a respectable length. I hope these files fulfill that need for people. Many thanks to the author of this page for actually computing them! https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/ 
P.S. Sorry they're separated into 5 files but github has a 100MB filesize cap!
